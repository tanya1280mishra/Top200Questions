## **1️⃣ Understand His Perspective**

He’s not here to drill you on syntax — he’s evaluating:

* **Can you think and design at scale?** (Distributed systems, fault tolerance, performance optimization)
* **Do you take ownership?** (From problem discovery → solution → measurable business impact)
* **Will you fit into a high-performance, product-focused engineering culture?**

---

## **2️⃣ Topics He’s Likely to Cover**

### **A. High-Level System Design**

Expect scenario-based discussions:

* Design a **high-availability booking system** for flights/hotels.
* Handle **payments** with multiple gateways and fallback mechanisms (he’s big on payment success rate optimization).
* Optimize for **latency, cost, and reliability**.
* Ensure **idempotency** in payment APIs.
* Scaling read-heavy & write-heavy components differently.

**Key points to prepare:**

* CAP theorem trade-offs in payment & booking flows.
* Circuit breaker & retry patterns.
* Sharding, caching, and load balancing.
* Real-time vs batch data processing in large systems.

---

### **B. Past Project Deep Dive**

He’ll want **impact, not just features**:

* Pick 2–3 projects from your resume (e.g., **SmartTalk LLM assistant**, **Green Hydrogen Estimator**, **3D MRI CVAE**).
* Structure answers with **STAR (Situation → Task → Action → Result)**.
* Highlight:

  * Business/user impact.
  * Scale of deployment.
  * How you handled performance, edge cases, and reliability.

---

### **C. Leadership & Collaboration**

He has managed **cross-functional teams**, so expect:

* A time you worked with **product + QA + DevOps**.
* How you handled **conflicting priorities** or **production incidents**.
* Mentoring or onboarding others.

---

## **3️⃣ Questions YOU Can Ask Him**

To show curiosity + alignment:

1. “I noticed you’ve spoken about payments being a growth driver at MakeMyTrip. How do engineering teams here measure and improve such business-critical metrics?”
2. “At MakeMyTrip’s scale, what’s the biggest technical challenge in ensuring reliability during peak seasons?”
3. “How do you balance rapid feature delivery with long-term platform stability?”

---

## **4️⃣ Quick Success Tips**

* **Mirror his language** → talk about *success rate*, *dynamic routing*, *cross-functional OKRs* — these are phrases he uses.
* **Show business awareness** → not just “I built a model” but “This reduced downtime / improved conversion by X%”.
* **Be concise but confident** → Directors don’t like overlong rambling.


Got it — you’re going in as a **fresher software developer** candidate at MakeMyTrip, interviewing with **a Director of Technology who has 14+ years of experience in large-scale distributed systems and payments**.

That means:
Even though you’re a fresher, **the bar will be high for fundamentals, problem-solving, and clarity of thought**.
They won’t expect you to have deep industry experience — but they **will** expect:

* Strong CS fundamentals
* Ability to reason about scalability
* Eagerness to learn and adapt
* Good communication & teamwork mindset

## **1. What This Interview Will Likely Cover**

### **A. Core CS Fundamentals**

They will check:

* **Data Structures & Algorithms** — Arrays, Strings, Hashmaps, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching.
* **Complexity Analysis** — Time & space complexity.
* **OOP Concepts** — Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction (with examples).
* **Database Basics** — Joins, indexes, normalization, simple SQL queries.
* **Networking Basics** — HTTP methods, client-server model, REST API basics.
* **Operating Systems** — Processes vs threads, concurrency basics, deadlocks.

---

### **B. Problem-Solving**

They’ll give **coding questions** like:

* Reverse a string without library functions
* Find the first non-repeating character in a string
* Merge two sorted arrays
* Implement a stack using queues (or vice versa)
* Detect a cycle in a linked list
* Simple BFS/DFS problem

---

### **C. System Thinking (Basic Version)**

Since the interviewer is from a **distributed systems/payments** background, you might get a **simplified system design** question like:

* “How would you design an online ticket booking system?”
* “How would you ensure two people don’t book the same seat at the same time?”
* “If payment fails after booking, how would you handle it?”

They don’t expect production-ready designs — they’re looking for **logical thinking and understanding of flow**.

---

### **D. Behavioral & Soft Skills**

Expect:

* “Tell me about yourself” (this sets the tone)
* “Why MakeMyTrip?” (research MMT’s products, values, recent news)
* “Tell me about a project you’re proud of” (college project, internship, hackathon)
* “How do you handle not knowing the answer to a problem?”

---

## **2. How to Prepare (Fresher-Friendly)**

### **Step 1: DSA Practice**

* Use **LeetCode Easy + Medium** (esp. Arrays, Strings, HashMaps).
* Learn how to **walk through your logic verbally**.

### **Step 2: Brush CS Fundamentals**

* **OOP** — be able to give real-world examples.
* **SQL** — `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`.
* **HTTP basics** — GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
* **OS basics** — process, thread, scheduling.

### **Step 3: Prepare a Good Introduction**

Structure:

1. **Background** — Education + any relevant project/internship.
2. **Skills** — Languages + tools you’re confident in.
3. **Projects** — 1–2 with clear impact.
4. **Why you’re excited about MMT** — link to travel tech, innovation, scale.

Example:

> "I’m Vaishnavi Thakur, a final-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science. I’ve worked on projects like an online food ordering system using Java and MySQL, focusing on database optimization and clean API design. I enjoy solving algorithmic challenges and recently completed 100+ problems on LeetCode. I’m excited about MakeMyTrip because it operates at massive scale, where small technical improvements can directly impact millions of users."

---

### **Step 4: Practice Scenario Questions**

They might throw:

* “If a user’s payment succeeds but booking fails, what would you do?”
* “How would you speed up a slow SQL query?”
* “How can you prevent double-booking of the same seat?”

For these, **focus on logical, step-by-step reasoning**, not perfect production solutions.

---

## **3. How to Answer in the Interview**

For **coding questions**:

1. Clarify problem statement.
2. Ask about constraints & input size.
3. Explain your approach before coding.
4. Write clean, readable code.
5. State time/space complexity.

For **system questions**:

1. Restate problem in your words.
2. Break into small components.
